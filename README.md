# SDG: Quality Education Analytics

This project explores Sustainable Development Goal: Quality Education using a dataset from a global education database. It includes Python-based analytics and a Power BI dashboard to uncover trends, and insights in education metrics across countries.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze and visualize education indicators across countries to:
- Identify trends and disparities
- Cluster similar countries based on education profiles
- Support data-driven education policy recommendations

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** Publicly available dataset on SDG 4
- **Data Type:** Structured CSV
- **Rows:** Varies by year and indicator
- **Columns:** Location, Year, Indicator, Value, Unit

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python** (pandas, seaborn, sklearn, matplotlib)
- **Power BI** (dashboard visualizations)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (analysis documentation)

---

## 🔍 Key Steps in Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates
   - Handled missing values
   - Converted types for analysis

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of indicators by country
   - Time series analysis (e.g., out-of-school rates)

3. **Clustering**
   - KMeans clustering of countries based on average indicators
   - Visualized in 2D using PCA

4. **Innovation**
   - Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest to flag outlier countries

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard (To Be Added)

**Features:**
- Line chart: Trends in dropout and literacy rates
- Bar chart: Indicator comparisons across countries
- Map visual: Education performance by region
- Slicers for year, location, and indicator
- KPI cards and drilldowns for detail

---


## 📌 Results & Insights

- Wide gaps exist in education quality between regions.
- Certain countries cluster together in similar educational performance.
- A few countries stand out as anomalies worth further investigation.
